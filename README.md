# Perpetual Learning Transformer (PLT) 🧠

Elevate your AI with the groundbreaking PLT approach. Achieve continuous learning and adaptation, ensuring your model remains relevant and informed.

## 🌟 Highlights

- **Continuous Adaptation**: Seamlessly integrates new information, keeping the model up-to-date.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Directly incorporate user feedback to improve model responses.
- **Real-time Knowledge Retrieval**: Accesses external data sources to fill knowledge gaps on-the-fly.
- **Safety First**: Robust output filters and moderation systems to ensure safe and unbiased responses.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone and Navigate**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd PLT-Implementation
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install torch
3. **Kick off the Learning**:
    ```bash
   python plt_starter.py

🛠 Future Roadmap

🌐 Evolve PLT to support multimodal inputs, spanning text, images, and sound.
🔍 Enhance the real-time knowledge retrieval system, enabling deeper and broader information integration.
🧪 Implement advanced evaluation metrics to continuously monitor PLT's performance and knowledge relevance.
